            <h3>Library Management System</h3>
            <p>The Library Management System is a C++ project designed to streamline library operations. It allows users to manage book records efficiently through functionalities like adding new books, displaying all books, and searching for books by ID, title, or author. The system also supports modifying book details and maintaining a list of disposed books. It uses file handling to store and retrieve data persistently, ensuring records are not lost between sessions. The program is menu-driven with options to navigate and perform various operations, making it user-friendly and practical for small-scale library management.</p>

            <h3>Wi-Fi Talking Robot</h3>
            <p>The Wi-Fi Talking Robot for Old People Education is an innovative 
                technology that aims to improve the quality of life of elderly people by 
                providing them with a new way of learning and socializing.
                This robot is designed to be user-friendly and easy to operate, making it 
                an ideal tool for seniors who may not be tech-savvy. As we age, it 
                becomes increasingly difficult to stay connected with our loved ones and 
                the world around us.
                This is particularly true for seniors who may have limited mobility or live 
                in remote areas. However, recent advances in technology have made it 
                possible for seniors to stay connected like never before One such 
                innovation is the Wi-Fi talking robot for old people.

            <h3>Hangman Game</h3>
            <p>This project is a Python implementation of the classic Hangman word-guessing game, enhanced with a hint feature to assist players.
                The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list and provides the player with a clue (a hint) about the word's meaning at the start of the game.
                As the player guesses letters, the program displays the word with correctly guessed letters and asterisks for unguessed ones.

                The player has a limited number of wrong guesses (6 by default). 
                After 3 incorrect guesses, the game provides a hint by revealing a random unguessed letter from the word to help the player continue.
                The game ends when the player either guesses all the letters correctly or exhausts their wrong guesses.</p>
